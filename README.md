Banking System – Core Java Project


This repository contains a console-based banking application built entirely using Core Java. The project simulates real-world banking operations such as creating accounts, managing deposits and withdrawals, checking balances, and recording transaction history. It is designed for learning and practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java along with exception handling and data management.

Key Features

Account Management

Create new accounts with unique account numbers.

Store customer details such as name, account type, and initial balance.

Deposit & Withdrawal

Securely add funds to a customer account.

Withdraw funds with balance validation to avoid overdrafts.

Balance Inquiry

View the current balance of any account.

Transaction History (Optional but recommended)

Maintain a record of all transactions for each account.

Data Persistence (Optional)

Save account details and transactions to a file.

Load data when the program restarts.

Core Java Concepts Used
Object-Oriented Programming

Classes & Objects – Represent accounts, transactions, and the banking system.

Inheritance – Create specialized account types (e.g., Savings, Current).

Encapsulation – Protect account data with getters and setters.

Polymorphism – Handle multiple account operations via a common interface.

Exception Handling

Manage invalid inputs (e.g., negative deposits, overdrafts).

Prevent program crashes with try-catch blocks.

Java Collections Framework

Use ArrayList / HashMap to store and manage multiple accounts.

File Handling (Optional)

Read and write account data using FileReader / FileWriter or ObjectOutputStream.

User Input Handling

Use the Scanner class for interactive console input.
